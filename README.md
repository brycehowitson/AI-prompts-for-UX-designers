# AI prompts for UX designers
## Overview
Bend generative AI models to your will. Here you'll find various Large Language Model prompts that you can use to ask generative AI tools for help in UX & Product Design tasks.

Initially, this repository will focus on prompts to generate prototyping content for use in mockups or prototypes. Though any language model can exhibit bias due to presence in training data, great care is being giving to generating realistic inclusive responses.

## Usage
Simply select the prompt you want, copy into your choice of chat based LLM (Chat GPT, Google Bard, BingChat, etc) and modify any text in [brackets] to your perferred values.

### Example
`Generate a list consisting of [quantity] items...` Most generative AI tools will default to a list of 10 items if not given another directive. Therefore, if you require a list with 200 items, you need to replace [quantity] with 200. `Generate a list consisting of 200 items...`

## Prototyping with generated content
It can be difficult to non-coders to use generated lists of content without dedicating excessive time to copy and paste activities. I recommend asking the AI tools to generate lists in JSON format. These lists can easily be consumed by developers to create "faked data" APIs or, there are several Figma plug-ins available to read JSON and apply it to layers in a document.

### Some Figma plug-ins for reading data in (Not I have not tested these)
- JSON to Figma [Figma Community Link](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985/JSON-to-Figma)
